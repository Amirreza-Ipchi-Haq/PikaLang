# Pikalang
This is an interpreter written in C for a joke esoteric programming language called Pikalang (Google this language for more information, or [the repository of the owner of this language](https://github.com/groteworld/pikalang)). The good feature about this interpreter is that it doesn't need to be installed and it's portable. Also, it's very simple and lightweight.
## How to get
You can open releases or click [here](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/Pikalang/releases) to get the pre-compiled executables, or you can compile the code yourself using a gcc compiler.
## How to use
To run a "Hello World" example, create a file with the following text:
```
pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pika pipi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pipi pi pi
pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pipi pi pi pi pipi pi pichu pichu pichu pichu ka
chu pipi pi pi pikachu pipi pi pikachu pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pikachu
pikachu pi pi pi pikachu pipi pi pi pikachu pichu pichu pi pi pi pi pi
pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pikachu pipi pikachu pi pi pi pikachu ka
ka ka ka ka ka pikachu ka ka ka ka ka ka ka ka pikachu pipi pi pikachu
pipi pikachu pika chu
```
Save the text and run it (Windows users can run this using the interpreter, just like any program). GNU+Linux users need to allow the execution of this program (You can google how to do this), then they can run the GNU+Linux executable in a terminal by typing `<ProgramLocation>/PikalangLinux <CodeLocation>/<CodeName>` (If the terminal is open where the program is, just put a `./` behind `PikalangLinux`)).

To run this in any directory, you have to add this to your global variables. You can search how to do it in each operating system.

This interpreter has command-line arguments. To see all of them, give the argument `--help` to the program.
## Sidenotes
This program uses the [strcal](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/strcal) library for some string operations.
